##Â DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

#### PARC

| PRINCIPLE       | JUSTIFICATION |
|:---------------:|:-------------:|
| **Proximity**   | Proximity is achieved by having logical sections for the content and keeping all relevant items together. For example the projects are all very close together especially on desktop as the projects can be seen on one row.
| **Alignment**   | All the different sections are similarly aligned and positioned so that they are all aligned together. None of the content on the website is randomly placed, this is to avoid any confusion for the user and makes it easier on the eye to read the content. |
| **Repetition**  | The website takes in to consideration the design aspect of repetition by applying similar styles to all the different sections and controls on the website, thus giving everything the same look and feel. |
| **Contrast**    | The contrast has been achieved with various aspects of the website a different colour to highlight it. For example the footer and modal have a different coloured background to the rest of the elements on the sites.

#### SITEMAP
Due to the website being a single page app a sitemap wouldn't be appropriate because there are no other html pages other than the index.html and one of the primary reasons for a sitemap is to help discover the different pages a website has.

## USER FEEDBACK

> Some of the colour scheme contrasts aren't clear enough. E.g. the button on the modal is one instance of this.

> The Navigation for the website is simple and accessible.

> External links to project git repositories could have been useful.

> No success message upon form submit.
